# Devbox ðŸ›  ðŸ“¦

My attempt to create a DevBox.


## Usage

Build image like:

`$ podman build -t podman-devbox .`

Use it like:

```sh
$ podman run --rm -it --name DevBox --hostname DevBox --pid=host --net=host \
    -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws \
    -v $HOME/.config/gcloud:/root/.config/gcloud \
    -v $HOME/Dev:/root/Dev \
    -v $HOME/Dev/DEVBOX:/root \
    -v `pwd`:/root/PWD podman-devbox
```

This command will inject your host AWS config and Gcloud config, to be used in the container.<br/>
Also the current folder is mounted in `/root/PWD`, which is the container's work dir.<br/>
I saved this long command as an alias.

The `/root/Dev` could be a folder with local projects, that you may want to have available in the container.<br/>
The `/root/` folder is persisted outside the container, so you can safely remove/ rebuild/ update the image and still have all the .asdf, .config, .local folders next time you run it.
